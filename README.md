# Bedrock Technical Resource Pack

Welcome to the Bedrock-Technical-Resource-Pack! This is a project that aims to provide tools to design and build farms in a survival/achievements enabled world.
This means we are not using behavior packs, commands, or other items that the normal player on a typical server would not have access to. To do that we have to
use an armor stand as an anchor for the tools as it is the only entity that can be placed on a single block and be switched manipulated. If a person can find a
way to make the tridents or other AI-free entities host several geometries we are looking for contributions.

## Overview

This resource pack enhances the visual feedback for many technical aspects of Minecraft, including:

- Hitbox visualization
- Spawning area indicators
- Redstone signal strength displays
- Entity behavior indicators
- And many more technical features

By making these normally invisible or hard-to-see game mechanics visible, this pack is invaluable for technical players, redstone engineers, map makers, and anyone interested in understanding how Minecraft works under the hood.

## Features

- Visual indicators for mob spawning ranges
- Enhanced armor stand functionality with special items
- Technical block behavior visualization
- Improved debugging capabilities for complex builds
- Compatible with the latest Minecraft Bedrock Edition versions
